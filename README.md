# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile

I'm **Christian Gleitzman**, a Computer Science undergraduate at the **University of Southampton**, having recently completed my first year. My passion lies in problem-solving and using code to build tools that are practical, creative, and impactful.

Before university, I took a deliberate break to reflect on my goals, develop my coding skills through personal projects, and work in retail. This time helped me strengthen both my technical foundation and soft skills - something I continue to build on through academic study and part-time work.

As I look ahead, I’m excited about pursuing opportunities in the tech industry where I can contribute to innovative solutions and gain real-world experience in software development, systems design, and data-driven technologies.
